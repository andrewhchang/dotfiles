# My Vim Setup

My Vim setup, with mostly sensible settings. It includes:

```
- Nerdtree plugin for file navigation
- Default theme onehalflight
- Ruby vim support
- Smart indenting
- Liquid template support
- fzf (Silver searcher required for :Ag search)
- Persistent window sizing
```
To use, install Vundle, open up a vim instance and run `PluginInstall`.
That's all!
